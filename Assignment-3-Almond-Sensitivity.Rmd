Tasks:
-- Develop a profit model for your almond yield (you can make this up; think about what the parameters would be) 
- you might assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly 
- there are many ways to combine the almond yield and profit functions;you can have the profit function “call”/use the almond  yield function; or create a wrapper function that calls them in sequence (first the almond yield and then the profit function) 

-- Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters

-- Create 2 graphs of the results - you can decide what is the most meaningful graph

-- Write a short paragraph (in the Rmarkdown document) to summarize you interpretation of your model results (e.g what do ‘take away’ from your model and sensitivity analysis
